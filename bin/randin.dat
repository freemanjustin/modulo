                    ! The list of learnt patterns is in PATTERN.DAT

! If RANDIN is being used then BRAINEX will be put into random input mode.
! A weight file must be read in. For each cycle a random pattern is 
! generated in the neural network and then allowed to settle to
! equilibrium. The result is compared to the set of learnt patterns
! to see if there is a match. A match is deemed to occur if the percentage
! of matching neurones equals or excedes the value of parameter 3 in the
! RANDIN image. At the end of the run a report is generated to see how
! efficient we were.
! The first parameter for the RANDIN card is the number of random inputs
! to present the neural net with.
! The second parameter defines the match percentage by which criteria
! a match will be accepted. For instance, 100 means we need a perfect
! match for acceptance, 80 means that a match of 80% will be sufficient
! for acceptance.  
! The third parameter is the name of the file to write the report to, if
! this file already exists then it will be appended to.

RANDIN 20 0 98  REPORT.OUT
    ! number of cycles through random inputs is 200.
    ! To be considered a match the generated pattern will need to be at
    ! least 98% the same as a learnt pattern.
    ! Report will go to REPORT.OUT. If REPORT.OUT already exists
    ! then the new report will be appended to it, otherwise
    ! it will be created.
